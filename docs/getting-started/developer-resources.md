## [REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/)

### [Core API](https://woo.com/wc-apidocs/index.html)

### [Store API](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/tree/trunk/src/StoreApi)

The Store API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, checkout, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/).
