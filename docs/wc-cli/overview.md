# WC CLI: overview

WooCommerce CLI (WC-CLI) offers the ability to manage WooCommerce (WC) via the command-line, using WP CLI. The documentation here covers the version of WC CLI that started shipping in WC 3.0.0 and later.

WC CLI is powered by the [WC REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/), meaning most of what is possible with the REST API can also be achieved via the command-line.

_If you're looking for documentation on the [WC 2.5 and 2.6's CLI go here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Legacy-CLI-commands-(v2.6-and-below))._

## What is WP-CLI?

For those who have never heard before WP-CLI, here's a brief description extracted from the [official website](http://wp-cli.org/).

> **WP-CLI** is a set of command-line tools for managing WordPress installations. You can update plugins, set up multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.

## WooCommerce Commands

A full listing of WC-CLI commands and their accepted arguments can be found on the [commands page](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/WC-CLI-Commands).

All WooCommerce-related commands are grouped into `wp wc` command. The available commands (as of WC 3.0) are:

```bash
$ wp wc
usage: wp wc customer <command>
   or: wp wc customer_download <command>
   or: wp wc order_note <command>
   or: wp wc payment_gateway <command>
   or: wp wc product <command>
   or: wp wc product_attribute <command>
   or: wp wc product_attribute_term <command>
   or: wp wc product_cat <command>
   or: wp wc product_review <command>
   or: wp wc product_shipping_class <command>
   or: wp wc product_tag <command>
   or: wp wc product_variation <command>
   or: wp wc shipping_method <command>
   or: wp wc shipping_zone <command>
   or: wp wc shipping_zone_location <command>

   or: wp wc tool <command>
   or: wp wc webhook <command>
   or: wp wc webhook_delivery <command>

See 'wp help wc <command>' for more information on a specific command.
```

**Note**: When using the commands, you must specify your username or user ID using the `--user` argument. This is to let the REST API know which user should be used.

You can see more details about the commands using `wp help wc` or with the `--help` flag, which explains arguments and subcommands.

Example:

`wp wc customer --help`

```bash

SYNOPSIS

  wp wc customer list [--context=<context>] [--page=<page>]
  [--per_page=<per_page>] [--search=<search>] [--exclude=<exclude>]
  [--include=<include>] [--offset=<offset>] [--order=<order>]
  [--orderby=<orderby>] [--email=<email>] [--role=<role>] [--fields=<fields>]
  [--field=<field>] [--format=<format>]


OPTIONS

  [--context=<context>]
    Scope under which the request is made; determines fields present in
    response.

  [--page=<page>]
    Current page of the collection.

  [--per_page=<per_page>]
    Maximum number of items to be returned in result set.

  [--search=<search>]
    Limit results to those matching a string.

  [--exclude=<exclude>]
    Ensure result set excludes specific IDs.

  [--include=<include>]
    Limit result set to specific IDs.

  [--offset=<offset>]
    Offset the result set by a specific number of items.

  [--order=<order>]
    Order sort attribute ascending or descending.

  [--orderby=<orderby>]
    Sort collection by object attribute.

  [--email=<email>]
    Limit result set to resources with a specific email.

  [--role=<role>]

    ---
    default: table
    options:
      - table
      - json
      - csv
      - ids
      - yaml
      - count
      - headers
      - body
      - envelope
    ---
```

Arguments like `--context`, `--fields`, `--field`, `--format` can be used on any `get` or `list` WC CLI command.

The `--porcelain` argument can be used on any `create` or `update` command to just get back the ID of the object, instead of a response.

Updating or creating some fields will require passing JSON. These are fields that contain arrays of information â€” for example, setting [https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#customer-properties](billing information) using the customer command. This is just passing key/value pairs.

Example:

`$ wp wc customer create --email='me@woo.local' --user=1 --billing='{"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"S","company":"Automattic"}' --password='he
llo'`

`Success: Created customer 16.`

`$ wp wc customer get 16 --user=1`

```bash

## Examples

Full documentation for every command is available using `--help`. Below are some example commands to show what the CLI can do.

All the examples below use user ID 1 (usually an admin account), but you should replace that with your own user account.

You can also find other examples (without output) by looking at [the testing files for our CLI tests](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/cli/features).

Each command will have a `.feature` file. For example, [these some payment gateway commands](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/cli/features/payment_gateway.feature).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I get a 401 error when using commands, what do I do?

If you are getting a 401 error like `Error: Sorry, you cannot list resources. {"status":401}`, you are trying to use the command unauthenticated. The WooCommerce CLI as of 3.0 requires you to provide a proper user to run the action as. Pass in your user ID using the `--user` flag.

### I am trying to update a list of X, but it's not saving

Some 'lists' are actually objects. For example, if you want to set categories for a product, [the REST API expects an _array of objects_](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#product-properties).

To set this you would use JSON like this:

```bash
wp wc product create --name='Product Name' --categories='[ { "id" : 21 } ]' --user=admin
```
